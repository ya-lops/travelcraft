    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Once a great Highborne city housing some of the most revered night elves
      of Kalimdor, Vashj'ir was swallowed by the Great Sea in the Sundering and
      thought to be lost forever. Queen Azshara, formerly a beloved leader of
      the Highborne, escaped death in the depths of the sea when the Well of
      Eternity imploded. Such salvation came at a great cost, as the queen and
      many of her fellow Highborne were forever transformed into the monstrous
      naga, doomed to wander the seas for thousands of years. Their existence
      mostly remains a mystery to the peoples of modern Azeroth, though the
      Earthen Ring has learned of Azshara's naga seizing Vashj'ir for an unknown
      purpose as the cries of the elements echo across Azeroth from the Abyss.
